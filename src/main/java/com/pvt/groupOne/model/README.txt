The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates the application's data and behavior. 
In a Spring application, models are typically Java classes that represent entities such as users, products, orders, etc.
In the context of a Spring application, the Model folder might contain Java classes representing entities annotated with @Entity if you're using Spring Data JPA for persistence.
