The Repository is part of the Data Access Layer and is responsible for interacting with the database. It abstracts the data access operations and provides methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.
In a Spring application, repositories are typically interfaces that extend JpaRepository or other Spring Data interfaces. These interfaces provide methods for querying and manipulating data in the database without the need for boilerplate code.
The Repository folder might contain Java interfaces representing repositories for different entities in the application, each extending a Spring Data repository interface.
