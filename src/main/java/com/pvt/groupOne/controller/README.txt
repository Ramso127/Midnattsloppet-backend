The Controller is responsible for handling incoming requests, processing them, and returning an appropriate response. It acts as an intermediary between the user's interaction (requests) and the application's business logic (models).
In a Spring application, controllers are typically Java classes annotated with @Controller or @RestController. They contain methods (annotated with @RequestMapping or similar annotations) that map incoming requests to appropriate actions.
The Controller folder might contain Java classes representing controllers that handle different parts of the application's functionality.
